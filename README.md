# Lucky_processing
Software use to track, process and stack star pictures. The main goal is to process focused and defocussed images that were taken on the same sensor.

## Context
This piece of software was developped in the scope of a bachelor thesis in microengineering at HEIG-VD (heig-vd.ch) formaly named "Caractérisation du télescope de l'observatoire solaire IRSOL (Tessin)" (Characterization of the IRISOL solar observatory telescope (Ticino))

## About tracking 
- speckle tracking is implemented
- centroïd tracking is not implemented
- 
## Main function

## Limitations
- .fits only
- Processing is done all at once. No batches to fit into the RAM.
## Status
Working, could be improved
